DeFi Lending and Borrowing Smart Contract
Overview
This project implements a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing system using Solidity. Users can deposit ETH, borrow against their collateral, and repay loans with interest.

Features
Users can deposit ETH as collateral.
Users can borrow ETH up to 50% of their deposited amount.
Loans accrue a 5% interest rate.
Users can repay their loans to clear their debt.
Secure and transparent transactions.
Smart Contract: DeFiLending.sol
Functions
deposit(): Allows users to deposit ETH as collateral.
borrow(uint256 amount): Enables users to borrow ETH based on their deposited collateral.
repay(): Allows users to repay their loans.
interestRate(): Fixed interest rate applied to borrowed amounts.
Deployment Steps
Open Remix IDE.
Create a new file and paste the DeFiLending.sol code.
Compile the contract using Solidity 0.8.x compiler.
Deploy the contract using MetaMask on a test Ethereum network (Goerli, Sepolia, etc.).
Use Remix UI or Web3.js to interact with the contract.
Example Transactions
Deposit: User deposits 1 ETH as collateral.
Borrow: User borrows 0.5 ETH (50% of collateral) with 5% interest.
Repay: User repays the loan along with interest (0.525 ETH).
Dependencies
Solidity ^0.8.0

MetaMask for Ethereum transactions

Remix IDE or Hardhat for deployment

Web3.js for contract interaction
